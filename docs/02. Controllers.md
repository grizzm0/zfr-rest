# Controllers

ZfrRest comes with an abstract controller that allows you to automatically dispatch based on verbs and actions.

## Simple example

This example allows you to handle the "get" and "delete" method. If a request with another verb is sent,
ZfrRest will automatically trigger a `405 Method Not Allowed` exception, with the `Allow` header fill with
acceptable verbs.

```php
use ZfrRest\Mvc\Controller\AbstractRestfulController;

class UserController extends AbstractRestfulController
{
    public function get(array $params)
    {
        // ...
    }

    public function delete(array $params)
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

All your REST controllers must extend `ZfrRest\Mvc\Controller\AbstractRestfulController`, each method must be the
name of the method.

> ZfrRest comes with a default implementation for the `OPTIONS` verb, by automatically checking the methods you
are implementing, and returning a response with a `Allow` header.

As you can see, ZfrRest controllers give you access to the route params directly, so that you don't need to
fetch them yourself.

You then need to add a route in your config, and add the controller to the controller plugin manager:

```php
return [
    'router' => [
        'routes' => [
            'user' => [
                'type'    => 'Segment',
                'options' => [
                    'route'    => '/users/:user_id',
                    'defaults' => [
                        'controller' => UserController::class
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        ]
    ],

    'controllers' => [
        'invokables' => [
            UserController::class => UserController::class
        ]
    ]
];
```

You can also add constraints (like for any Segment route). As you can see, you do not need to pass any `action`
default, because the method to call will be inferred from the request method. In this case, the params array would contain
the `user_id` variable, that you can use to fetch the user from a service, for instance.

ZfrRest fully supports child routes, and the params will contain both the params from the parent route and children
routes.

## Validation

ZfrRest controllers come with a simple method called `validateIncomingData`. It accepts an input filter name, and
an optional validation group. What ZfrRest does when calling this method is:

1. Retrieving the input filter from the input filter plugin manager.
2. Extracting the JSON data from the body.
3. Running the input filter against the data. If values are valid, they are returned to you (after being filtered),
otherwise, ZfrRest will automatically format the errors, and return a `422 Unprocessable Entity` error to the client.

Example:

```php
use ZfrRest\Mvc\Controller\AbstractRestfulController;

class UserController extends AbstractRestfulController
{
    public function put(array $params)
    {
        // Only validate email, first_name and last_name
        $values = $this->validateIncomingData(UserInputFilter::class, ['email', 'first_name', 'last_name']);

        // If we are here, the values are considered valid
    }
}
```

The `validateIncomingData` also accepts a third optional parameter that will be passed to the `isValid` method of
the input filter as a context. This can be used to add/remove input based on context.

## Hydration

Often, you will use validation in conjunction with hydration. To that extent, ZfrRest offers a similar helper called
`hydrateObject`. It accepts a hydrator name, an object to hydrate and values:

```php
use ZfrRest\Mvc\Controller\AbstractRestfulController;

class UserController extends AbstractRestfulController
{
    private $userService;

    public function __construct(UserService $userService)
    {
        $this->userService = $userService;
    }

    public function put(array $params)
    {
        // Only validate email, first_name and last_name
        $values = $this->validateIncomingData(UserInputFilter::class, ['email', 'first_name', 'last_name']);

        // We can hydrate, but because it's an update, we must first get the user
        $user = $this->userService->getById($params['user_id']);

        $this->hydrateObject(UserHydrator::class, $user, $values);
    }
}
```

## View rendering

Finally, you should render the resource. Rendering is handled in views (not in controllers). Views work similar to
standard PHP views, and will be explained in the next section.

At this point, what you need to know is that you need to return a `ZfrRest\View\Model\ResourceViewModel` from your
controller:

```php
use ZfrRest\Mvc\Controller\AbstractRestfulController;
use ZfrRest\View\Model\ResourceViewModel;

class UserController extends AbstractRestfulController
{
    public function get(array $params)
    {
        // Get your user...

        return new ResourceViewModel(['user' => $user']);
    }
}
```

## Combining HTTP verbs and actions

In previous versions of ZfrRest, it was impossible to combine RESTful controllers with standard actions. This leaded
to code duplication (more routes, more factories, more controllers).

Indeed, some actions do not map well to pure REST. For instance, if you have an "invite" object to invite someone
to your board, you can do a `POST invites` request, that will create the invite, and send an email to the user. However,
mapping an action such as "resending the invite email" is hard to map in REST. Instead, a simple RPC-like action
like `POST invites/:invite_id/resend` is often simpler (sometimes, practicity win over theory).

To that extent, ZfrRest controllers "understand" action and can dispatch requests to the action. To do that, you
must update your route definition to add an optional parameter called `action`:

```php
return [
    'router' => [
        'routes' => [
            'invites' => [
                'type'    => 'Literal',
                'options' => [
                    'route'    => '/invites',
                    'defaults' => [
                        'controller' => InviteListController::class
                    ]
                ],
                'may_terminate' => true,

                'child_routes' => [
                    'invite' => [
                        'type'    => 'Segment',
                        'options' => [
                            'route'    => '/:invite_id[/:action]',
                            'defaults' => [
                                'controller' => InviteController::class
                            ],
                            'constraints' => [
                                'action' => 'foo|bar'
                            ]
                        ]
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

In this example, we have created a route hierarchy. Assuming that your `InviteController` has methods `get`,
`put`, `post`, those will be called for URI like `/invites/4`. If you add an action that match your constraint,
like `/invites/4/foo`, then it will fallback by calling the `fooAction` in your controller.

Note that even for RPC-like actions, you will receive the `params` array in your method.
